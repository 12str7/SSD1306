# Matrix Keyboard

M×N matrix keyboard driver.

## Summary

You can connect any M×N Matrix Keyboard, theoretically, by using M+N GPIO pins, N pull-down resistors, and a ground pin.

(M is number of rows and N is number of columns.)

You can also use any compatible GPIO controller like [Mcp23xxx](../Mcp23xxx) instead of native controller.
