## Samples
The Mcp960X.samples file contains a sample usage of the device. Note that this reads two temperatures. One is a connected thermocouple reading which can be read using the  ```GetTemperature``` command and the other is the temperature of the device itself which can be read using the ```GetColdJunctionTemperature``` command. The Cold Junction Temperature is used internally to increase the accuracy of the thermocouple but can also be read if you find a use for it.
