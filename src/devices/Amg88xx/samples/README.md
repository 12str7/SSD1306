# Demonstration of AMG8xx binding usage

## Introduction
There are AMG88xx breakout boards available from a variety of the known vendors. You can use nay of them as long as it provides the I2C interface of the sensor directly.

**Note:** There are also boards available with additional interfaces or even an integrated Arduino compatible curcuit. You probably can't use them as the binding supports a direct I2C connection only.
