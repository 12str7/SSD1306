# APA102 (Double line transmission integrated control LED)

APA102 is a intelligent control LED light source that the control circuit and RGB chip are integrated in a package of 5050/2020 components. It internal include 3 groups shift register and Selfdetection sign decoder circuit.

It's different from WS2812 that it need a serial data line and a clock line. So APA102 has no strict requirements for data line timing. It's better for use in devices such as Raspberry Pi that can't precisely control the timing of data lines.
