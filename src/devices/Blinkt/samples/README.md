# Blinkt! - Samples

The samples can be operated via a menu in the samples program. These samples are ported from the Blinkt Python library repository <https://github.com/pimoroni/blinkt/tree/master/examples>.

Samples:

* [One-Dimentional Tetris](1DTetris.cs) - Shows randomly coloured lights falling into place and clearing occasionally.
* [Binary Clock](BinaryClock.cs) - Shows time in hours, minutes, and seconds using the local time from your Pi.
* [Binary Clock Meld](BinaryClockMeld.cs) - shows time in hours (red), minutes (green) and seconds (blue) using local time from your Pi.
* [Gradient Graph](GradientGraph.cs) - Pulses a rainbow across the blinkt and back again.
* [Graph](Graph.cs) - Pulses a magenta graph across the blinkt and back again.
* [Rainbow](Rainbow.cs) - Shows a gently moving rainbow along the blinkt. Yay, rainbows!
