# Cpu Temperature

Device bindings for the CPU Temperature Sensor

## Summary

Returns the current temperature of the CPU Temperature Sensor. Useful telemetry in its own right, but also useful for calibrating the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.
  
Note: No hardware needs to connected for this to work. It gets the CPU core temperature, typically about 40 degress Celcius.  
On a Raspberry Pi. it does not work with Windows 10 IoT-Core; Raspian is the required operating system. 

Same as ```/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp```
