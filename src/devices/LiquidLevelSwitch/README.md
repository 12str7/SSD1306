# Digital liquid level switch

Digital liquid level switches are devices that can detect the presence of liquid/water. GPIO can be used to communicate with the devices.

## Devices

The implementation supports the following devices:

- LLC200D3SH sensor ([Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/3397/3397_datasheet_actual.pdf))

## Usage

An example on how to use this device binding is available in the [samples](samples) folder.

The following fritzing diagram illustrates one way to wire up the Optomax LLC200D3SH digital liquid level switch with a Raspberry Pi.
