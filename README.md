# .NET Core IoT Libraries

.NET Core can be used to build applications for [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) devices and scenarios. IoT applications typically interact with sensors, displays and input devices that require the use of [GPIO pins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output), serial ports or similar hardware.

This repository contains the [System.Device.Gpio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Device.Gpio) library and implementations for various boards like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Hummingboard](https://www.solid-run.com/nxp-family/hummingboard/).

The repository also contains [IoT.Device.Bindings](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Iot.Device.Bindings), a growing set of community-maintained [device bindings](src/devices/README.md) for IoT components.

Note: System.Device.Gpio is in early preview. It is not yet supported and will continue to change. It is currently published to myget (requires use of [nuget.config](samples/led-blink/nuget.config)).

## How to Install and Get Started

You can install the latest daily pre-release build of the .NET Core System.Device.Gpio and IoT.Device.Bindings nuget packages from the [dotnet.myget.org feed](https://dotnet.myget.org/feed/dotnet-core/package/nuget/System.Device.Gpio).

#### NuGet.exe
~~~~
nuget install System.Device.Gpio -PreRelease -Source https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json
nuget install IoT.Device.Bindings -PreRelease -Source https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json
~~~~

#### .NET CLI
~~~~
dotnet add package System.Device.Gpio --source https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json
dotnet add package IoT.Device.Bindings --source https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json
~~~~

After installing, see the [samples/README.md](samples/README.md) for step by step instructions on building your first app.

## Community 

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/)
to clarify expected behavior in our community. For more information, see the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).

## Contributing

Please contribute. We are primarily interested in the following:

* Improving quality and capability of the drivers for supported boards.
* Implementations for additional boards
* [.NET device bindings](src/devices) for a wide variety of sensors, chips, displays and other components.
* Links to blog posts or tweets that showcase .NET Core being used for great IoT scenarios (file an issue).
* Request a device binding or protocol that you need for your project (file an issue).
